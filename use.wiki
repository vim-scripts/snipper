Summary How to use snipper

= Installation =

 * Unpack snipper-0.1.tar.gz to some dir
 * link .vim/templates to /path/to/snipper/templates
The script will search for files that contain the filetype and are xml files.
   So if you have templates for python, you could name them python-templates.xml and    place that file in ~/.vim/templates
   If you have scribes installed you can also use those and link to ~/.vim/templates/ to ~/.scribes/templates

 * You need vim with python enabled to use this script


To let the script work place these lines in your .vimrc:
 * link snipper to ~/.vim/scripts/snipper
 and place this in your .vimrc
 pyfile ~/.vim/scripts/snipper (or the place where you have downloaded snipper)
imap <tab> <C-o>:python template.trigger()<CR>
autocmd BufRead * python template.reInit()
autocmd BufNewFile * python template.reInit()

= Use =
enter a defined template and press tab
